          <p>
            Welcome to our Final Space fan page! This is a class project for the
            “HTML and CSS - Aula 1” course at the Online University of
            Catalonia. We’ve used the Final Space API to bring you the most
            accurate and up-to-date information about the show.
          </p>
          <p>
            Final Space is an epic animated sci-fi comedy about a spaceman named
            Gary who is working off a prison sentence and makes a mysterious new
            alien friend Mooncake whom he immediately bonds with. But what Gary
            doesn’t know is that his adorable new sidekick is actually wanted by
            the sinister Lord Commander who will stop at nothing to use
            Mooncake’s untapped powers for evil.
          </p>

            Our website is divided into several sections for your convenience.
            In the “Categories” section, you’ll find detailed information about
            the series, neatly organized by characters, locations, and episodes.
            Whether you’re looking for information on your favorite character or
            want to learn more about the show’s various locations, we’ve got you
            covered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “Presentation” section provides an in-depth overview of our
            website and its features. Here, you’ll find everything you need to
            know about how our site works and how to navigate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, our “Links” section contains all the documentation and
            sources we used to gather content for the website. Here, you’ll also
            find copyright attributions and other important details. We believe
            in giving credit where credit is due, and we’ve made every effort to
            acknowledge the sources of our information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve put a lot of effort into this project and we hope you enjoy
            exploring the universe of Final Space as much as we do!
