          Welcome to our fan page dedicated to the thrilling series, Final
          Space! This website is a class project for the “HTML and CSS - Aula 1”
          course at the Online University of Catalonia. We’ve used the Final
          Space API to bring you the most accurate and up-to-date information
          about the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website is divided into several sections for your convenience. In
          “Categories”, you’ll find detailed information about the series,
          neatly organized by characters, locations, and episodes. The
          “Presentation” section provides an in-depth overview of our website
          and its features. Lastly, our “Links” section contains all the
          documentation and sources we used to gather content for the website.
          Here, you’ll also find copyright attributions and other important
          details. We’ve put a lot of effort into this project and we hope you
          enjoy exploring the universe of Final Space as much as we do!
